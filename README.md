Usage: logalyzer.pl log_file.log

The Logalyzer is a template for creating a script to parse any standard apache or tomcat log files. 
Edit the regular expression depending on your log format and then just write and conditional logic you require
such as printing counts or URI's. It's really up to you how you implement it.
